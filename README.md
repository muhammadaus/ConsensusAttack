# ConsensusAttack
A simulation for all coordinated consensus attacks

*Added Mock Bitcoin Core
Note:
This is a simplified simulation and does not include many important aspects of a real blockchain, such as consensus mechanisms, transaction validation, or network communication. It is meant for educational purposes to illustrate the concept of multiple nodes interacting with a blockchain.
